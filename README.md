# Regex to NFA Converter

This project converts regular expressions (regex) into Non-deterministic Finite Automata (NFA) and displays the NFA using SFML (Simple and Fast Multimedia Library). The visualization is limited to displaying up to 100 states and includes transitions between states.

## Features

- **Regex to NFA Conversion:** Converts a given regex expression into an NFA.
- **Visualization:** Displays the NFA graphically using SFML.
- **State Limit:** Capable of displaying up to 100 states.
- **Transitions:** Visualizes transitions between states.

## Requirements

- **SFML Library:** This project requires the SFML library to be set up in Visual Studio. You can download SFML from [SFML’s official website](https://www.sfml-dev.org/).

## Setup Instructions

### Install SFML:

1. Download and install SFML from [SFML’s official website](https://www.sfml-dev.org/).
2. Follow the instructions to set up SFML in your Visual Studio environment.

### Open the Project:

Open `regex-to-nfa.sln` in Visual Studio.

### Build the Project:

Build the project using Visual Studio. Ensure that SFML is correctly linked in your project settings.

### Run the Application:

Execute the application to convert regex expressions to NFA and visualize the result.

## Usage

- Enter a regex expression to convert it into an NFA.
- The resulting NFA will be displayed, showing states and transitions, with a maximum of 100 states.
